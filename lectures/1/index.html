    <h1>HTML</h1>
    <p>
        <strong>HYPERTEXT MARKUP LANGUAGE</strong> <em>(HTML)</em> is a markup language for defining the structure, layout, and content of webpages. HTML was originally designed by <strong>TIM BERNERS-LEE</strong> in 1993. Since then, HTML has been standardized, maintained, and developed through time by various organizations such as the <strong>WEB HYPERTEXT APPLICATION TECHNOLOGY WORKING GROUP</strong> <em>(WHATWG)</em> and the <strong>WORLD WIDE WEB CONSORTIUM</strong> <em>(W3C)</em>. Together with <strong>CASCADING STYLE SHEETS</strong> <em>(CSS)</em> and <strong>JAVASCRIPT</strong> <em>(JS)</em>, they are considered the three fundamental pillars of the web. 
    </p>
    
    <p>
        In more lenient terms, HTML is often likened to the foundation, i.e., the walls and floors of a house or the skeleton of a human, CSS to the presentation, i.e., the interior and exterior home decorations or the human skin, and JS to the function, i.e., the utilities, furniture, etc. in a house or the organ systems in the body. Together, these three components work to form a complete, functional system.

    <p>
        Code which represents HTML documents are known as <strong>HTML SOURCE FILES</strong> or <strong>HTML MARKUP</strong>. These files, stored on a web server, are received by web browsers, which are then rendered into a page. The resulting content structured and displayed from HTML markup are referred to as <strong>HTML DOCUMENTS</strong>. 
    </p>
    
    <p>
        HTML documents can be represented as a tree of nodes known as HTML elements, its basic building blocks, each of which can contain content, such as text and images, as well as possess HTML attributes that define the properties and behavior of that element. HTML source files are stored in plaintext files using the file extensions <code>.htm</code> or <code>.html</code>. 
    </p>

    <h1>Elements & Attributes</h1>
    <p>
        <strong>ELEMENTS</strong> are the components that make up an HTML document, such as paragraphs, images, or section headings. Through HTML, documents with structural semantics (i.e., focusing on function over form) can be made efficiently. Elements are delimited in an HTML markup with tags, identifiers enclosed in angle brackets. 
    </p>
    
    <p>
        <strong>TAGS</strong> are sequences of characters enclosed within angle brackets in an HTML source file, which together with their enclosed content, represents an element, such as &lt;p&gt;, &lt;img&gt;, or &lt;h1&gt;. Browsers do not directly display these tags; rather, they use the tags to understand how to organize the elements within an HTML document.
    </p>

    <p>
        It is important to note, however, that elements are distinct from tags. The entire entity enclosed between a start and end tag of the same type is referred to as an element; the tags only serve to set the scope and content of each element in an HTML source file.
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>ATTRIBUTES</strong> are keywords used to define and modify the behavior of elements in an HTML document, such as id, class, or style. They are defined in the opening tag of an element most often as name-value pairs, and rarely as single keywords. Values for attributes are often enclosed in single or double quotes, though there are cases where it might not be required.
